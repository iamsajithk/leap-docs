## Generating Music

To generate a music simply call the `music.` method on your `Leap` instance. You must pass in a prompt, and set the duration. 

```ts copy
  const { data, error } = await leap.music.submitMusicGenerationJob({
    prompt: prompt,
    duration: duration,
  });
```

Generating music takes between 30 seconds and 3 minutes in most cases, this depends on the duration you set. 

This will submit the job and then immediately return with the status of the job being `queued`. To retrieve the result simply call the `listMusicGenerationJobs` method. 

# Retrieving Music

```ts copy
  const { data, error } = await leap.music.listMusicGenerationJobs();
```

# Types

Generating music will return a single `LeapMusicSchema` object, and fetching the list will return an array of `LeapMusicSchema` objects.

```ts copy
export type LeapMusicSchema = {
    id: string;
    createdAt: string;
    state: "queued" | "failed" | "finished" | "processing";
    prompt: string;
    media_uri: string | null;
};
```

## In Progress

Music endpoint does not yet support webhooks, but we do plan on adding this soon.

Please reach out to help@tryleap.ai and let us know what else you'd like us to add, or if you have any suggestions for how to improve this.
